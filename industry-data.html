6Team and the IT Industry
								</h2>
<p>
The IT industry is an ever-changing space that bends do the needs and desires of the business and individuals that benefit and profit from its utility and the advancement of these useful technologies. In order to stay relevant in the current IT ecosystem it can be important to look at what skills are in demand currently as a rational for current learning, and an indicator for the path ahead in your journey into IT and it’s implementations. Burning Glass has provided us with crucial insights into the current state of demand in skills of the broad IT field, which has allowed us to analyse our current standing in terms of demand, and determine if our previous decisions of direction in the field are suitable to our own goals, and the goals of the field at large. <br> <br>
What in demand skills does 6Teem have already? 
Allan’s ideal position as Helpdesk/IT Support was not listed and did not have a corresponding position listed in the data supplied. Deon’s ideal position was a software engineer, specifically for VR. Even though no VR specific job titles were listed, Software Engineer itself was listed at rank eleven in the data supplied. Adam’s ideal job was listed as a Software Developer, meanwhile, Tomas’ was a Junior developer role and Kylie’s was a mobile games developer. Though there were no games related titles or junior specified roles listed, all three of these positions would fall under the software developer title which came in at number nineteen on the burning glass data. <br> <br>
The required IT skill set our group identified, using the data provided, included coding languages such as C#, Java, .NET, CSS, and javascript. There were also two game engines, Unity and Unreal that were noted as specifically required for two of our positions. 3D technology and animation were also noted along with tech support for several positions. Two of our ideal careers require very specific knowledge one of which in Microsoft Windows and the other in virtual reality technology. <br> <br>
Some of the general skills we identified as necessary for our group, consisted of communication, customer service, multitasking, teamwork, troubleshooting and problem solving, organisation, leadership, management. It should be noted that customer service skills were included in the IT skills data set and not the generic skill set and that is reflected in the following paragraphs. <br> <br>
When looking at 6Teens overall required skill set in IT and comparing it to the burning glass data, we immediately hit three of the top four IT skills that employers are looking for. None of our positions specifically required SQL which is the top skill these companies seem to be seeking however javascript, java and Microsoft windows fall into second, third and fourth respectively. Each of these are required for at least one of our ideal positions. Graphic design, technical support and the C# programming language fell into tenth, eleventh and twelfth place, with customer service, software engineering and .NET programming then following at the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth place. Despite more than one of our ideal positions calling for them, the Unity and Unreal game engines, as well as animation 3D technologies and VR specific technology were not on the list at all and the CSS programming language was also not specifically stated. Although it was noted in the general skillset by our group, customer service skills were included in the IT skills data, as such customer service falls fourteenth in list of IT skills. <br> <br>
Our general required skills in group 6Teen include communication, multitasking, teamwork, troubleshooting and problem solving, the ability to be organised and meet deadlines and in the case of the senior positions' leadership and managerial skills. Based on the Burning Glass data Communication skills were the most important followed by problem solving and organisational skills. Teamwork and troubleshooting follow closely behind these at numbers four and five with the leadership and managerial skills further down the list at numbers eleven and nineteen. Meeting deadlines came in at number sixteen and Multi-tasking skills at number twenty on the data supplied. <br> <br>
The three highest ranked IT specific skills that were not in our groups required skill set were, as noted before: SQL followed by project management and SAP. <br> <br>
The three highest ranked general skills that our group did not identify as required skills were writing, planning and being detail oriented. <br> <br>
Kylie’s Thoughts
After viewing this data, my ideal career position has not changed. I would still enjoy creating and developing games. Whilst the specific position I took note of did not have much correlation to the top skills or positions in the burning glass data, the IT world is constantly changing and this data might be obsolete by the time I am ready to apply for positions such as my ideal job. It is also important to note that I am not going to apply for positions based on what others think is good or any industry data but rather on what I wish to do with the skillset that I have. If I do change my mind on my ideal career path, it will be because I have found something else I enjoy and would like to do, and have focussed on that, rather than being based on industry trends. <br> <br>
Allan’s Thoughts
After looking through the data, my mind stays the same on my chosen ideal position as Help Desk Support. While my decision wasn't based around having desirable skills in the industry and was more to do with my own strengths, and putting them to use in a field that I'm more interested in, the Burning Glass data actually supports this decision to stay with the goal of this chosen position. The Data suggests that strong communication skills, problem solving, and writing skills, all things I believe I excel at, are in high demand in industry, and with 1830 jobs in technical support areas hiring in the last 90 days of publication, my endeavour to make it into that field seems not only like a good long term goal, but one that I could even be highly competitive towards. And while I may not have all the most highly desired skills mastered (I have little experience in Leadership roles, Planning positions or Researching), taking into account the industry trends it seems that staying this path aligns with what I want to do, and what the industry desires. <br> <br>
Tomas’s Thoughts
While my ‘ideal job’ is not a highly sought-after job according to the data, I do believe I would highly enjoy it and that it will exponentially develop my skills as a professional. For these reasons, my opinion on my ‘ideal job’ stays the same. I know that the IT field can be challenging, but as this is something that I really enjoy, I am going to persevere with my goals and try to work my way up. I believe that my ‘ideal job’ is a fantastic starting point for any developer and maybe one day I could enhance my skills enough to move up to a more senior position. As for the general skills, many of them I believe I already possess and others I will continue to enhance. However, these are not involved in my decision as to what career path to follow as every career requires soft skills that need to be developed. <br> <br>
Deon’s Thoughts
My vision for the future has not changed, however it has been further informed. I think that my goals for my career are to pursue the fields and technologies that interest me the most. My ideal job may change as technologies do but my goal will be to develop software for these developing technologies. The basic skills that the burning glass data suggests are ones that I have to keep
developing. Although I think I have good problem-solving skills and creativity, my communication needs to be improved. The IT skillset is something I am firm on, the top skills in the data are something to keep my eye on in order to improve my employability. So my passions have no changed, but my ideal job might depending on how the future of technology pans out. <br> <br>
Adam’s Thoughts
After reviewing the data, I do believe that my ideal job may change but it’s worth noting that I’m targeting to learn a set of skills to be able to do a variety of different tasks and potential jobs because my mind can change quickly, or my interests might peak in another direction. I believe that my current ideal job is one of my major goals to achieve, I know that I have the intelligence to achieve it and I will continue pursuing what I am interested in. 
In saying that there are definitely some skills that I will have to work extra hard on improving to reach these goals, I believe that my teamwork and communication could use some improving and I'm taking as many steps as I can to improve and I would also like to note that I’m constantly learning new programming techniques, skills and projects to further those skills, whilst undertaking a Bachelor in Information Technology to gain some amazing insight from true professionals.
