								<h2><a href="#">An Interview with a Web Developer</a></h2>
								<p>
									An Interview with a Web Developer
Team 6Teen completed an online chat interview with software engineer Sebastian McKenzie. <br> <br>
The first question is an introduction, who are you and what is it that you do? <br>

I'm Sebastian McKenzie. I went to school with Deon. I'm 23. When I finished high school, I moved to Sydney and worked at a web agency for 3 months called Thinkmill. After that I moved to London and worked at a company called Cloudflare, for again, only 3 months. Since then I've been working at Facebook for almost 5 years. My first 3 years were in London, until I moved to the US 2 years ago. I'm quitting Facebook in May though and I'm joining Discord. 
The main reason I was able to get the opportunities I have, is because I've developed some very popular open source projects. Notably https://babeljs.io/ when I was in year 12 and then https://yarnpkg.com/ when I joined Facebook. <br> <br>

Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? <br>

I've primarily worked on developer tooling. However, I have spent some time last year with the team who was working on the new Facebook.com. I helped build out the necessary front-end infrastructure. Right now, I'm on the React Native team https://reactnative.dev/ building Rome https://github.com/facebookexperimental/rome. React Native is a mobile framework that allows you to write cross platform apps using JavaScript that utilize native UI. Rome is a project that I started that's intended to be a toolchain for JavaScript and has the functionality of about a dozen different tools currently. <br> <br>

Could you give us a typical overview of a normal workday? <br>

Generally, I'll have at minimum of a few meetings per week, so everything is based around that. It would typically include a full team meeting, a 1:1 meeting and maybe another dedicated meeting with other people from the team. So, I just sleep at whatever time, wake up whenever, and just make sure I'm in the office before my first meeting of the day. Some days I'll just work from home and video call into a meeting. There's a ton of different engineering offices in other cities or just on campus, so a lot of the time meetings may have remote participants anyway. I have not been in the office for like 4 months now though as I'm currently on paternity leave. <br> <br>

Please tell us about the industry you work in. <br>

It's broad, since I specialize in developer tooling that every company needs or uses. More specifically I guess it's mostly "web development" since my focus is on JavaScript, however it's used a lot on the server and now mobile apps. <br> <br>

What other kinds of work do you have to do? <br>

Internally: Planning every 6 months. Keeping everyone up to date on project progress. Externally: Since I work on open source projects there's other responsibilities. Reviewing code from contributors. Triaging issues and fixing bugs. I am basically the lead on these projects, so I must be involved in everything. <br> <br>

Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. <br>

Managers: This includes my direct manager, as well as the manager of my team. The team is large enough that there's multiple managers, however there's still a hierarchy. 
Direct co-workers: Other people on my team. <br>

Indirect co-workers: Random people on other teams who are interested in my work, will be impacted by my work, or who I will need to work with. <br> <br>

Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. <br>

Other people will ask me for code reviews, and I'll also help with theirs. All code needs to be reviewed by at least one other person. This doesn't have to be someone on your team, it could literally be anyone at the company. So, I get pulled into code review on things that aren't my direct work but may have been things I've worked on in the past or have a lot of context on. Planning: This involves both people on my team and managers. The team has priorities and goals so if you want to work on something it's a shared responsibility to see if it makes sense and fit it in. I've changed teams when what I wanted to work on wasn't a priority for the current team that I was on but was for others. There are also times where you need to "lobby" and make the case for why something is worth investing in. <br> <br>

At all the companies I've worked at managers have always been there as an assistant rather than as a "boss". Meaning they're more there to serve you than tell you what to do. It includes things like career growth plans, compensation, planning, and can include things like them getting support for you to work on what you want or work together on a compromise. <br> <br>

Competition is a thing at massive engineering companies that have resources to waste. For infrastructure work it's not uncommon to develop multiple things in tandem with the objective being to only pick the "best" one in the end. It's almost a game of politics at times. If you're working on something and a team on the other side of the company were planning on working on it, then it's can be down to who has the most social capital. <br> <br>

Could you tell us a bit about communication and teamwork vs working solo in the IT industry? <br>

Communication being shared is a bit different to working solo. You can work independently on things but still need to keep other people on the team informed. If anything, the more independent you are, the more you need to communicate since there's no transparency into what you're doing. If you do a lot of planning then you don't really need to do a lot of communication other than "this is where I'm at, refer to the project documentation". The project documentation isn't formal, it's just something unstructured and informal like a Google doc. <br> <br>

I also think it's important to note that my experiences are as a software engineer at very engineering heavy companies with a very generous culture, lifestyle and benefits <br> <br>





What about your interactions with clients or investors? <br>

Sebastian doesn’t interact directly with clients or investors and so he could not give us an answer for this question. <br> <br>

What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. <br>

Recently, programming. I have the necessary support from the rest of my team and management, therefore I don't really need to do any planning since everything has already been planned. <br> <br>

Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?  <br>

At Facebook, it's been conflicts with other teams. A lot of software companies are fairly ‘bottom up’. This means that generally priorities and work is decided by the engineers rather than management (except for product work). This generally results in other teams having strong opinions on what you're working on. This is especially relevant for any infrastructure work which needs to touch other components that other teams own. There is also the issue of timelines not aligning. At Facebook all planning is around halves. So H1 and H2 of each year. You may need to work with other teams on something so you either need to make sure they plan to help you, or if you have a dependency on them then you might have to wait until they have time. <br> <br>

Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? <br>
For me I think it is the ability to work on things that effect a large portion of the world. eg. working on software that thousands of companies end up using. Small actions can have a huge ripple effect if they're useful. This is a list of companies using Babel for example https://babeljs.io/users I think the fact that it was all possible without any formal education beyond technical output is also a testament to a unique aspect of the industry. <br> <br>
