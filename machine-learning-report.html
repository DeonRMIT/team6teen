									A brief look into the future of Machine Learning technologies
								</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Machine Learning today is performing a gradual takeover of many industries, replacing handcrafted solutions developed last century with computed solutions on the back of incomprehensible amounts of data. Automatic Differentiation is the powerhouse behind current Machine Learning technologies in conjunction with Neural Networks. These two concepts allow the creation of very complex behavior in a system after passing Gigabytes upon gigabytes of data through them to find that one solution that makes it work so well. Current uses of these systems are used for financial security with fraud detection algorithms[1],sales systems with machine learning powered chatbots for customer service[3], and even the self-driving cars that are beginning to flood into the streets have their odometry systems all powered by these Machine Learning algorithms[2]. These technologies are all flooding overall development of Machine Learning with more and more capital, only increasing the speed of creation for new uses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Progress in machine learning doesn’t come without its pitfalls however, continued research often requires a monumental amount of data and computing resources to achieve state of the art results. In August 2019 Nvidia “train[ed] BERT-Large in just 47 minutes. This record was set using 1,472 V100 SXM3-32GB 450W GPUs and 8 Mellanox Infiniband compute adapters per node.” (Shar Narasimhan for Nvidia) These state of the art models often have these expensive computing requirements, to push large amounts of data through them to the point where they become the best to date. This reliance on large amounts of resources can make improvements difficult with current techniques, and may require new solutions to be developed and researched for continued improvement.
							</p>
							<p>
								Machine Learning isn’t a complete technology just yet however, and it continues to grow into new useful products every day from new differentiable computing systems, to self driving vehicles and natural language understanding models. “The most compelling thing about having a program tune itself is that it allows us to create the sorts of programs we seem to be completely incapable of programming by ourselves.” (Joaquín Alori, Tryolabs) Machine Learning opens a host of new opportunities in the realm of programming with the ability to create programs in a new data orientated fashion. This use is still in its infancy, but research is being poured into the area by the likes of Google in their “Swift 4 TensorFlow” initiative to bring this new style of programming to the masses. “A wealth of possible ways to embed words have been proposed over the last five years.” (Thomas Wolf, Huggingface) For Language models the state of the art keeps being pushed to its limits, and over very short periods of time. We’ve gone from simple systems to tag parts of sentences to gigabyte large models capable of doing complex analysis of not just English but almost any other language in such a short period of time, and these benchmarks are being pushed past all the time. With this constant growth and industry support this coming decade is going to be filled with news of an increasing number of meaningful advancements in development and use of machine learning.

								These improvements and adaptations to current Machine Learning processes could cause a disruption in many different facets of modern society, becoming more reliant on these technologies as they begin to displace workers in existing fields, and open up new fields entirely. “[A]utomation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely.” (Calum McClelland for iotforall) These new automation practices in machine learning could lead to drastic changes in how business operates, and the effect that has on society at large. All this is on the back of machine learning techniques that can replace human operators in different pipelines, or improve other efficiencies that can cause havoc in a marketplace. But it isn’t all about removing workers, “[i]magine creating an AI that can diagnose disease and handle medications, address lawsuits, and write articles like this one.”(Calum McClelland for iotforall) Machine learning techniques open up doors that we haven’t been able to before, which may lead to rise of new industry and a shift in demographics in the workplace. Low skilled labour often shrinks in the face of technological improvements, and with these machine learning models being able to replicate human workforces for simple tasks the population will have no choice other than to more to more complex highly skilled labour, or fall out of the workplace. It’s difficult to say how strong this impact will be on the whole of society, but it’s already been taking on a steady pace thus far, and is likely to continue until it's left its mark.

								On the individual level this shift could either be completely transparent, or a large and growing concern for friends and family alike as these large data crunching algorithms become an increasingly large part of their lives, upsetting their work and creating new privacy issues. These concerns have been growing over the past years, with privacy currently at the forefront of the debate. “[...] Australian universities, researchers, and technology companies are actively collaborating with oppressive regimes to use technologies like facial recognition against vulnerable groups[.]” (Electronic Frontiers Australia Chair Lyndsey Jackson) Mass surveillance has been a growing issue throughout this century and machine learning only enables it to be more effective, creating only more privacy concerns about where your data is really being used for and how best to approach keeping your privacy in check in this digital world. You may need to change your internet habits, be careful of what cameras can see you, or even try to hide your presence from these machine learning technologies to keep your privacy in tact. In the case where there will be a more immediate impact to occupations, the people you know may be feeling it already. “[...] Convoy’s digital freight network combines our dense network of carriers with the use of machine learning models to fully automate the process of matching and pricing a truck to a load, which can happen in minutes, not hours.” (Ziad Ismail of Convoy) Machine Learning automated systems can replace many typical jobs involving automation and data analysis, and humans may simply not be working many of these jobs in the future. This may result in a need for everyone to change how they approach the workplace, and maybe even if they need to go back to school. Whether it’s taking extra precautions in your online presence, or studying for a different skill set, everyone will be feeling the effects of new machine learning technologies.
