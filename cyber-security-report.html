								<p>
									An unsecured mess
								</p>
							</header>
							
							<p>
								Cybersecurity is something that often seems overlooked by the average user. Cybersecurity, in short, is the protection of unwanted access, theft, and access to sensitive data. [1]There are many systems that are at risk of cybersecurity breaches, such as but not limited to financial systems, utilities and industrial equipment, aviation, consumer devices, large corporations, automobiles, government and even medical systems, the list goes on. Impacts of cyber-attacks have a significant impact financially which could estimate anywhere between $13 billion to $266 billion, although the reliability of these estimates is often challenged.							</p>
							<p>
								There are a lot of cyber-attacks possible in the digital world, but here are three types of attacks with brief descriptions.
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<b>Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</b>
									<ul>
										<li>
											[2] “Unlike attacks that are designed to enable the attacker to gain or increase access, denial-of-service doesn’t provide direct benefits for attackers. For some of them, it’s enough to have the satisfaction of service denial. However, if the attacked resource belongs to a business competitor, then the benefit to the attacker may be real enough.”
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.</b>
									<ul>
										<li>
											[3] “In this type of MitM attack, an attacker hijacks a session between a trusted client and network server. The attacking computer substitutes its IP address for the trusted client while the server continues the session, believing it is communicating with the client.”
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Phishing and spear phishing attacks.</b>
									<ul>
										<li>
											[4] “Phishing attack is the practice of sending emails that appear to be from trusted sources with the goal of gaining personal information or influencing  users to do something. It combines social engineering and technical trickery. It could involve an attachment to an email that loads malware onto your computer. It could also be a link to an illegitimate website that can trick you into downloading malware or handing over your personal information.”
										</li>
										<li>
											-	“Spear phishing is a very targeted type of phishing activity. Attackers take the time to conduct research into targets and create messages that are personal and relevant. Because of this, spear phishing can be very hard to identify and even harder to defend against. One of the simplest ways that a hacker can conduct a spear phishing attack is email spoofing, which is when the information in the “From” section of the email is falsified, making it appear as if it is coming from someone you know, such as your management or your partner company. Another technique that scammers use to add credibility to their story is website cloning — they copy legitimate websites to fool you into entering personally identifiable information (PII) or login credentials.”
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>
								In terms of what developments are being made in the cyber security field, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, most businesses are opting to work from home, doing this shows an increase in cybersecurity risks. [5] BitDam which is a leading provider of cybersecurity measures in communication for enterprises has announced new support features of their current advanced threat protection to now protect Microsoft Teams and Zoom, these programs now provide protection from malicious files and links of any type, quarantining malicious files, five-minute deployments for the entire organization, seamless to end-users. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity appears to be quite an effective way of mitigating cyber-attacks, cybersecurity is consistently changing which therefor will always require constant developments and staying on top of newer and unique ways cyber-attacks are delivered. Machine learning approaches have been utilized to prevent network intrusion problems, to elaborate on this a little there are three general phases that are used.
							</p>

							<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
								<li>
									[6] <b>Preprocessing:</b> the data instances that are collected from the network environment are structured, which can then be directly fed into the machine learning algorithm. The processes of feature extraction and feature selection are also applied in this phase. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Training:</b> a machine learning algorithm is adopted to characterize the patterns of various types of data and build a corresponding system model. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Detection:</b> once the system model is built, the monitored traffic data will be used as system input to be compared to the generated system model. If the pattern of the observation is matched with an existing threat, an alarm will be triggered.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								Some upgrades that are being introduced this year in the military section of cybersecurity a rather fascinating development is being made by Lockheed Martin, [7] This spring, work will begin to install the components needed to command and monitor the M-Code (Military Code) encrypted GPS signal, this will enhance anti-jamming and provide protection from spoofing, also increasing the secure access for forces. It is said that with these new upgrades these signals will be 8x improved in terms of anti-jamming capabilities. 
							</p>

							<p>
								[8] “GPS is an attractive target for our adversaries, so it was critical that we bring our best cybersecurity defenses to the table” – Stacy Kubicek, Vice President of Mission Solutions Defense and Security). 
							</p>

							<p>
								[9]Jamming GPS Signals is actually a process of using a frequency transmitting device to block or interfere with radio communications, types of communication that can be jammed include phone calls, text messages, GPS systems, and wi-fi networks, this is also known as ‘GPS spoofing’. These devices were initially developed by the military to misguide the enemy about geographic locations and targets. When there’s a good side to things, they can usually turn bad and have, they were sold to consumers that were worried about their privacy or prevent tracking, but without proper technical training or perhaps placed into the wrong hands it could have dire consequences, leading us further into the fact that where prevention is put in place, a backdoor or consequence is there waiting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Impact of these developments have already been listed, automation measures are being used and yielding far greater percentages of prevention, detection etc. M-Code upgrades will strengthen the militaries use of GPS and anti-jamming capabilities and prevent spoofing, which will lead to greater accuracy and overall, more secure usage. If we look at the broader perspective of which people cybersecurity upgrades and new developments will be most affected the answer is and always will be everyone.

								Whether the developments are in military, regular computing, software, virus detection etc. It will always come down to protecting everybody that uses these services which nowadays would be nearly impossible using any of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the world of Information Technology begins to excel at such a fast rate, the constant improvements, developments, new software, programs also comes with the increasingly large number of new sophisticated ways that people are trying to exploit that and commit cybercrimes all over the world, this in turn means that jobs in cybersecurity will always be on a rise as the volume and rise of these attacks/crimes are seemingly not coming to a stand-still by any means.
							</p>

							<p>
								[10] A 2019 press release by Global Market Insights indicated that It is anticipated by the year 2024 that the cyber security market will be a $300 billion industry. In fact, it seems that the amount will be much more than that as technology advances exponentially.
							</p>

							<p>
								In conclusion, cybersecurity is an ever-growing industry and an important one in the information technology world, everyone’s data, personal information or sensitive information is at risk and cybersecurity experts are dedicated to finding solutions to fix or adapt to these issues/attacks, the industry is set to soar greatly in the coming years, and will need to be maintained consistently.
