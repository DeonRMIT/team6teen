Describe the Project <br>
Education is an important part of life and with our project we aim to bring education to people in a way that is accessible and engaging for those who cannot simply stare at a text book and understand a concept, we introduce play into the learning sphere through Happy Training Fun Times. We propose a platform for creating educational games and applications that give creators a core set of tools for creating their application, a framework for distributing these applications onto websites across the internet, and a platform for distributing these applications to whoever may want to use them. <br> <br>
Why does the world need this project? <br>
Different topics can be complicated to understand, and being able to play with the concepts in a curated manor could be the difference between discovering a deep understanding of something new, and turning your nose up at a challenge that is too complicated. Happy Training Fun Times allows this element of play in learning to explore this area and find what can be effective in achieving learning outcomes for students, regardless of age or experience with a topic. This is all capable because of advances in computing technology, with graphical displays and fast calculation abilities we can begin to discover just how far we can push learning with these new gamified systems. <br> <br>
What would it take to make this project? <br>
This project at its core makes use of different web technologies as the foundation for what is a learning service. HTML and Javascript will make up the front end of the service, displaying the different creation tools and offering a portal for exploring the different games on offer. The games themselves are going to be distributed online, and therefore need to be accessible by web browsers as well. This accessibility will be achieved by using Javascript again for the interactive elements of the applications. All of this front end needs a strong backend as well, which will be provided by a Node.js server operating as our webserver, and providing the necessary backend services for hosting the webpages and related systems for the applications that will be developed.  <br> <br>
What do we intend to create for this project? <br>
In the time allocated to us, we believe we can make a good effort into creating the website itself, with basic creation tooling and discoverability options, as well as create several games ready for distribution. The complexities of this project scale with the number of users of the service, the number of applications hosted, and the number of related services for these applications.
The creation hub will be fleshed out with different tools to create games with simple physics and graphical capabilities, allowing creators to begin immediately on publishing games on the platform.
In the distribution center, we will have a fully list to explore the different applications available, with sufficient meta-data to sort through them and find the learning experience that you need.
All of this will be packaged and presented in a way that is embeddable onto arbitrary webpages for people to begin exploring and learning immediately. <br> <br>
Wrap it up <br>
With the creator’s portal running, and exploration of the games available, we’re confident that the first few Happy Training Fun Times experiences can be functional as a learning aid immediately, and being to see results about the effectiveness and marketability of such a system. 6Teen’s differing skill sets all make up a part of completing this task, with experience with backend and front end systems in a variety of different languages and design work. We’re confident that we can make something special that will push both the field of Information Technology and Learning disciplines forward.
