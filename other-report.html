							<h3>What is a block chain?</h3>
Whether it be bitcoin, some other cryptocurrency or even the word popping up online from time to time I am sure you might have some interest in finding out what a blockchain actually is.<br> <br>
“A blockchain is a distributed ledger completely open to everyone.” (Savjee, 2017)<br><br>
This ledger records a series of blocks composed of some data, say an action or transaction, and two security hashes. One hash identifying the current block, and one hash identifying the previous one (MURRAY, 2018). As each block points to the previous one this creates a chain of these blocks, this is called a blockchain. <br><br>
This ledger is as stated before distributed openly to everyone, this means everyone keeps their own copy of it. So that the ledger is kept not on one sole computer, but on every contributing member of the ledger’s computer. This makes the ledger incredibly difficult to change, making it a reliable log of transactions. If one wants to tamper with the ledger, first you would have to change the hash of a block and all blocks after it. Then you would need to overwrite at least fifty percent of every copy of the ledger across the network so that the change is seen as legitimate (Savjee, 2017).<br><br>
In order to prove yourself as a member, a network will require proof of work. Which is usually the computer performing perform a set of increasingly difficult calculations, this is often called mining (MURRAY, 2018). These calculations take the computer time to do, this period acts as a buffer to how many changes a computer can do in each time period. With this it acts as another layer of security to the blockchain in that for a computer to attempt to tamper with the whole blockchain would have to take a vast amount of time to do so (Savjee, 2017). There are other methods to prove themselves as a member, such as participants buying tokens, but this depends on the blockchain itself (MURRAY, 2018). .<br><br>
<h3>Current and Future Uses</h3>
<br>
Currently blockchains are used in a plethora of technologies the biggest of which being cryptocurrency or ‘crypto’. Crypto uses blockchains to record transaction details for using tokens for payments, these tokens may be earned through the previous method of mining (Frankenfield, 2019). <br> <br> 
Another such technology Is also in the financial sector. Banco Santander in 2018 started tracking their international money transfers using blockchain. (Business Insider Intelligence, 2020). <br>
Blockchain can also be used to keep self-executing and self-enforcing contracts called smart contracts. (Reiff, 2020). <br> <br>
In addition, blockchain can be used in the business sector such as for keeping a log of all goods and allocating them. It can also be used to keep track of things like a person’s medical history in a secure but accessible way, with concerns over privacy being negated by the information having no key identifiers on its own. These uses also helping with storing the mountains of information that continues to be catalogued in these areas (Business Insider Intelligence, 2020). <br> <br>
Recently in 2019, a company called Eluvio Inc. started a platform to distribute video to users without the need for centralized databases and help protect the intellectual property of the videos (Business Insider Intelligence, 2020). <br> <br>
Blockchain technology continues to advance with methods such as federated blockchain, a blockchain that is separated into separate authority nodes that different organizations can control. Which means information can be shared on a network while keeping information restricted in key areas (Vikram, 2020 ). <br> <br>
On top of this stable versions of cryptocurrencies are being developed which intend to have limited amounts of fluctuation and act as layers of security for the volatile nature of crypto (Vikram, 2020 ). <br> <br>
Another trend is the use of blockchain in social media to help protect privacy and control data (Vikram, 2020 ). <br> <br>
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<br>
Blockchain has the potential to play a major role in anywhere where security and precision is needed when handling information. <br> <br>
As stated, prior uses of blockchain are being explored in sectors such as law for contracts, financial for money transfers, shipping for data logs, medical for patient history, and even media distribution. <br> <br>
This means that jobs involving administration and the bookkeeping for such records of information could lend its hand towards being automated. <br> <br>
Conversely this would mean jobs involving cybersecurity, developing software utilizing blockchains, data entry in transferring analog records to digital, and specialist such as accountants to help verify the integrity and authenticity of the blockchain just in case data does get breached. <br> <br>
“The cryptocurrency market is worth more than 250 billion US Dollars (USD) and needs all kinds of different people to support it.” (BitDegree, 2020). <br> <br>
The major job openings due to blockchain and crypto are from start-ups, legacy organizations, tech firms and governments (BitDegree, 2020). <br> <br>
•	Jobs are being for start-ups looking to advance or break into the blockchain industry whether they are trying to create wallet software for cryptocurrency, educational tools, new forms of crypto or other blockchain based innovations.
<br> •	Legacy companies such as banks, accounting firms and law offices are hiring experts in blockchain to help stay on top of the emerging technology.
<br> •	Large tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, Apple and Facebook are looking for blockchain experts to help them implement the technology as it provides a decentralized take on data storage.
<br> •	Finally, governments are looking into reducing costs using crypto and blockchain in their institutions.  

<br> <br>
Forbes put the top four areas in which blockchain is creating jobs are developers who create solutions using blockchain, project managers to organise and direct projects, designers whose goal is to make the blockchain more accessible to the end-user, and legal consultants as the technology branches into legal concerns when handling information (Marr, 2018). <br> <br>



<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
In terms of my own daily life it can seem lofty for the technology to have any tangible impact, but as always, it’s the little things that count. <br>
One big way would be a movement from the stereotypical currency to a cryptocurrency. This would mean a change in how payments and transfers are made, and the pricing of goods may change. Long gone the days of different prices on a product based on location or having to convert from currency to currency. As the Australian dollar trends downward so does the worth of my bank account. <br>
Another way is the processing of information may become faster for me, as organizations trend towards using blockchain for data. Perhaps in the future government organizations will have a unified database where all organizations are part of a federated block chain, data is secure and protected while at the same time accessible to the proper authorities at a given notice. <br>
There might be a time when behind the scenes the information kept by social media is done through blockchain. Kept decentralized but somehow more secure as big giants may find it hard to harvest data from an encrypted blockchain, out of the hands of a unelected authority. Data breaches and user details being leaked changing from one hacker against the security protocols of a single entity to the security of an entire network.  Although indeed this seems to be far off and perhaps impractical, time will tell. <br>
For my friends and family, it might seem as if it is all not worth any of their time. They may be right. Blockchain is a technology that is hard to be felt by the end user, holding many risks and challenges. Crypto currency may fail to get truly off the ground, or it may replace the petrodollar.  <br>
One thing is for sure, an emerging technology can either take over the tech world or it can fall to the wayside as something else does its job better.  <br>
