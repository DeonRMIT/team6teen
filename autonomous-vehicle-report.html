								<h2><a href="#">Autonomous Vehicles</a></h2>
								<p>
Autonomous vehicles, simply put, are driverless vehicles. They are vehicles which can operate themselves without human interaction by using their ability to read the environment that they are in through computers and sensors. However, there are different levels of driverless vehicles such as fully autonomous or semi-autonomous. This type of technology is not limited to just cars, they could also be used in vehicles including trucks, buses and trains. <br> <br>
[1] There are 6 different levels of automation. As outlined in the table below, when the level of automation rises, the human interaction decreases. <br> <br>
Level	Description of interaction
Level 0	The human does all the driving.
Level 1
	The vehicle’s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) can support the driver with steering, accelerating and braking.
Level 2	The ADAS can oversee steering, accelerating and braking in some conditions but the human driver must always pay attention. The human will also do any remainder tasks.
Level 3:	The advanced driving system (ADS) can complete all tasks of driving in some conditions. The human must be able to take over. In the other conditions the human will take control.
Level 4:	The ADS can complete all tasks in some conditions without human input.
Level 5:	This involves full automation where a vehicles ADS can perform all tasks in all conditions.
<br> <br>
“Autonomous cars work using sensors, actuators, complex algorithms and processors to execute software” [2]. Using these technologies, the vehicle creates a virtual map of the environment that surrounds it. Radar sensors also monitor where nearby vehicles are in relation to the autonomous vehicle and this is used to instruct the computer to accelerate, steer and brake. The sensors work by sending out a pulse of light and timing how long it takes for the light to rebound off an object and return to the sensor. From this, we can work out the distance of objects compared to the autonomous vehicle. The vehicle can also detect curbs and vehicles when parking by using very sensitive sensors in the wheels of the vehicle. Cameras are enabled to detect for cars, road signs, traffic lights and even pedestrians. The information gained by sensors is used by the computer to instruct the car how and where to move, helping it navigate lanes and objects. <br> <br>
More companies are starting to venture into autonomous vehicles design and development however a lot of discussion on the topic is based on what the vehicles could do in the future. There is currently little implementation of the technology in our society. The main well-known example is the Tesla model cars. They use a software called “Autopilot” which “enables the car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its own lane” [3]. Tesla cars are a level 2 on the automation scale as they can drive autonomously in most conditions, but the driver must always watch the road [4]. A less well know project for automatic vehicles is Googles “Waymo”. This is a level 4 autonomous vehicle because in most instances it could be capable of driving with no human input. <br> <br>
Autonomous vehicles are a lot about the future and what we could implement. We may start to see more vehicles appearing on the roads gradually and eventually we could have a society where there are only autonomous vehicles. Depending on the scale of autonomous vehicles, we could have much different impacts on the world. If society used only autonomous vehicles, we may build large infrastructure to support this. <br> <br>
If implemented correctly, autonomous vehicles could be a revolutionary technology, however there are various factors to consider. A key concern by many and one that is at the forefront of the debates surrounding this technology is regarding the safety of these vehicles. Whilst this is a reasonable concern, it is most likely that the computer will make less mistakes than humans and therefore cause fewer overall accidents. This is still under great study as we have little evidence to support either way as there is not enough implementation on the roads. <br> <br>
Another prominent feature for autonomous cars is the potential to enable accessible transport for individuals who have disabilities that do not allow them to be in control of a vehicle. This would allow these individuals to be able to get around without relying upon someone else, giving them a greater degree of freedom and opportunity. We would also see reduced numbers of dangerous drivers on the road, whether the driver isn’t paying attention or under the influence of alcohol. With autonomous vehicles these people would now be able to get around without having a potential to cause accidents. 
While there are plenty of positives to autonomous vehicles but there are also some major negatives to consider. A large problem being ethics. The computer in charge wont necessarily think the way of an ethical human in every situation. A situation could easily arise where the computer must make a tough decision, maybe the lesser of two evils, and we cannot be sure how the computer will react. This can raise other questions too. If a situation were to occur like this, can the driver take over and who would be responsible for choosing the ‘correct decision’. Dilemma’s such as these, need a lot of consideration before we can make autonomous vehicles work. <br> <br>
The consequences of introducing something like this into todays life would be extraordinary. We need to consider the economic, environmental and social impacts. A huge positive for the concept is the development of necessary infrastructure. This would create a huge quantity of jobs and demand for certain resources that could stimulate the economy for many years to come, however on the flip side of this, millions of other people could lose their job. For example, people who work in long haul trucking would be replaced by a computer to control the vehicle across country. This would save a lot of money for many companies and could make produce cheaper as transportation would cost less but then lots of people will now be looking for jobs. This doesn’t include the taxi and uber drivers who will now have no income as they have most likely been replaced by an automated rideshare vehicle.  <br> <br>
As for the environment, the resources required to build new infrastructure that could support a development like this could be enormous, and we would need to re-purpose all the non-autonomous vehicles that are already in circulation. We wouldn’t want to waste these products. However, there would be a market for more electrical cars like Tesla which would reduce CO2 produced and released in the atmosphere. <br> <br>
The social aspect of driving could become a thing of the past though. A lot of people enjoy driving and some collect cars as a means of hobby. This could all be ruined by a system that introduces certain vehicles that qualify to be ‘driven’. Many people are united in community with cars as a medium for them to share their enthusiasm, what will happen to this? Will driving sports still be allowed or could they become frowned upon? There is no doubt that a lot of positives could develop from a world that works through autonomous vehicles, but there are so many consequences that are less than ideal and need consideration. <br> <br>
