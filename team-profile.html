							<h3>Adam Baker: s3851571</h3>
							<p>
								My name is Adam Baker! I was born and raised in Geelong, Victoria. 
								My academic achievements are an equivelent of Year 10 completed through TAFE and I'm currently studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT. 
								My favorite hobby is self teaching myself to program games and experiment applications in C# using software such as Unity Engine and Visual Studio!
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<center>
								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								I have had an interest in IT since I was i believe to be 6 years old, My mum and dad showed me our first computer and i was immediately transfixed by it. 
								I played a game on an ABC website and didn't want to stop! ever since then i had a laid back approach to it, 
								i used it for social reasons and gaming but never really decided to pursue knowledge on an academic level, however in my early teens i started to become curious about how to make my OWN programs.
								So i experimented, for the last 8 years i have been doing that on and off and only recently decided 
								it was time to take my knowledge to the next level by studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT.

							<p>
								Allan, Born 21st of February 1995, grew up in Melbourne's Eastern Suburbs where he attended primary school known for it's focus on German language and culture. 
								His highschool career was rocked by illness, moving onto studying at Distance Education before finishing his VCE certificate at a local highschool. 
								In his younger days Allan was very interested in soccer, playing for his local team as captain for several years before his interests changed. 
								For the last three years Allan has been working at a local Martial Arts school as their program manager, keeping everything up and working, and keeping students happy and in their classes.

								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								My interest and experiences in IT started when I was young, with my father showing me simple programming in Visual Basic he learned for his job at a pneumatics factory in the late 90s. 
								He showed me how to make simple visual interfaces to make text change and start to develop little games from big books that captivated me at the time. I took off from there in my explorations of IT, 
								learning several different programming languages, at the time to make video games, and eventually working at websites and physical hardware as well. This all stemmed from those late nights with my father, 
								expanding my interest both at that time and moving on into the future of this complex and fascinating world of IT.

								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded 
								from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing togther my own at 16.

							<h3>Kylie Mayne: s3824213</h3>
							<p>
								I am a single mother of 2 pre-teen children, one of which is autistic, I have come to study late in life in my mid 30’s to begin pursuing an education 
								I can use to further my careers prospects once my children are a little older.
								I only completed grade 10 in my high school days, and have been a stay at home mother for 12 years so I have found this something of challenge.
								I live in North Queensland and have in fact, never even left the state. I love to play video games and you can find me reading (usually a fantasy series) at least once a day.

								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								My interest in IT started at a very young age, my Grandfather began working with computers and teaching himself everything he wanted to know in the early 90’s. 
								We were quite close and so I was often with him as he built a computer, or fixed them, or just experimented for his own learning. We had all the gaming systems growing up, 
								starting with the Atari and the family often spent weekends out in our garage playing the latest games together. As I got older I began purchasing my own equipment and teaching myself 
								how to build computers and fix problems, both software and hardware. My current PC was purchased nearly 14 years ago and has died and been repaired many times by myself, it’s still going strong. 
								I am fascinated with the concept of game design and coding and really enjoy reading the rise of small companies making amazing games. If those guys can do it, then maybe I can as well.

							<h3>Tomas House: s3858839</h3>
							<p>
								My names Tomas. I’m 21 years old and I’m from a town just outside of North London. 
								I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. 
								In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. 
								I want to soon take up boxing or muay thai but just haven’t gotten around to it yet. 
								An interesting fact about me would be that I’m currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.
								<br>

								<h3>IT Interest</h3>
								<p>
								As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I’ve enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. 
								I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I’m pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, 
								it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool 
								with how technology based our society is nowadays. If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. 
								As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an 
								extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.
