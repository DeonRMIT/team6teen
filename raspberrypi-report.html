								<h2><a href="#">Raspberry Pi and Arduino</a></h2>
								<p>
									Computing power over the last few decades has maintained its rate of rapid growth both in computing power for price, and accessibility of the hardware. “[G]raphics cards provide just over 75 TFLOPS half precision [at $0.03 per GFLOP] ” (Wikipedia history of GFLOPS costs, n.d) The cost keeps dropping for increased hardware capability, and this increased function of devices is moving non-trivial computing into new mediums and allowing projects that required hardware that used to be either too expensive or simply unavailable. Raspberry PI and Arduino units both fill this new low cost, high processing capability market and inject innovation into an already fast paced industry. <br><br>

									In the case of Raspberry Pi these small computing devices are capable of a great many things in this new competitive low cost space. The Raspberry Pi is marketed as a small computer capable of doing everything a normal PC can, including using the internet, watching videos, playing games and perhaps most importantly coding and programming. (What is a Raspberry Pi?, n.d.) These miniature computers have expandable hardware including but not limited to a digital TV receiver, power over ethernet (PoE) modules and several different camera modules, there are those that work as a normal camera and video camera, others have different capabilities for example the Pi NoIR camera is widely used by plant and wildlife hobbyists to both monitor plant health for which the company provides a blue gel, and for use in night time photography of wildlife. (Pi NoIR Camera V2, n.d.) Though this device is largely marketed towards older children and teenagers as a way of teaching them computing, coding and other technology, the Raspberry Pi has become a staple for a large demographic of older IT technicians and professionals as well as those who simply want to learn. There is a massive database of ideas and projects for the Raspberry Pi as well as an extensive range of completed programs for use with the Raspberry Pi and it’s extra components. The project idea’s are incredibly extensive, some examples being: Using a Raspberry Pi as a TV streaming device, using them to create and code games, hosting a file server, as a web server, as a component of a robot, photography projects and even to control technologies within a home such as turning electrical items on or off, lights music and other electrical devices. (Projects, n.d.) <br><br>

									The Arduino is a similar device to the Raspberry Pi. It consists of a small microcontroller board capable of reading inputs and instructions and then performing the appropriate actions afterwards. The software required to code what the Arduino board is being used for can run on Windows Linux and Mac, and is coded using the Arduino programming language, in their IDE software. (Arduino - Introduction, 2020) Just as with the Raspberry Pi there is a large community of Arduino users who have compiled a forum full of information tutorials and help for all users. (Arduino Forum, 2020) With smaller and cheaper electrical and computing components being made available these small computers and controller boards are available for the everyday user to purchase and begin learning and using them at a very cost-effective price for the abilities that they offer. As these smaller computers become more powerful there will be

an increase in the already amazing abilities these computers offer. Larger robots will be built, more powerful miniature computers for personal use, more space will be available for those using the Raspberry Pi as a file or web server, and resource heavy and graphically intensive games will become perfectly playable on these small devices.<br><br>

The potential impact of this increased availability of microcomputers and microprocessors is not likely to be large or sudden, but instead a developmental creep the likes which has already evolved from the inclusion of personal computers in the home, to phones and smart devices becoming more prevalent in our everyday lives. More people will be able to automate their homes or devices, but with this technology, they will be able to make that automation suit themselves and for a cost that is lower than any of the solutions available on the market near as ten years ago. The technological minded person could create their own series of devices used to control only the aspects they wish to, or perhaps they would create features that aren’t available on the current generation of commercially available devices. There is already an amazing array of applications these devices are used for and we can expect that these will be improved both in terms of hardware, and software support for development both by individuals and businesses the same. Using the example mentioned earlier of the night time wildlife photography, with the advent of better cameras being designed and developed there would be clearer pictures taken, improved software could tell the camera when it needs to take the picture, adjust for light issues, flare and glare, and other issues such as removing blur due to motion. This radical availability of cost reduction of personal computing power may never be the next mobile phone, but in certain key fields these devices will continue to further innovation and may well be the building blocks for the next wave of consumer hardware. <br><br>

On a personal level these microcomputers and controllers do not in fact affect me (Kylie) much at all, aside from the technology already in my mobile phone. Where I live personally our houses are almost universally turn of the last century and often don’t have the required power point availability to run the devices you would find in a normal household, let alone one with extra technological functionalities. One thing that does intrigue me, though I don’t believe the capability is available as yet would be the ability to house a large and intensive video game within a small Raspberry Pi or similar microcomputer, though it likely would only run that one game that is something I could feasibly see myself using. Being able to transfer that game from house to house or even within my own home would be fantastic. Though I do have an external hard drive already for backup purposes the idea of having a miniature computer with my most important and recent data backed onto it, ready to go and be used in a moment in case of problems or crashes with my main computer is also a very attractive idea. None of my family or friends are very technical minded or have much passion for anything technological so to be perfectly honest I couldn’t see anyone I know personally who would use or derive any benefit from these devices either now, or as they might be in the future. As a not very good gardener

myself I could see some wonderful usage for the plant photography detailed on the Pi NoIR camera (n.d.) website, being able to see if my plants are healthy without digging them out to check for root rot or other issues unnecessarily would mean healthier and sturdier plants.<br><br>
